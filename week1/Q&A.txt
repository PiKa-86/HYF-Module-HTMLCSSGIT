1)Q: How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

A- You can create a hidden file by adding . to the begginnig of file name

                         touch .filename
 But who uses Windows they have to type attrib command like this:

   attrib +h path to file
   
here +h means "hide a file" file

- And to make a file unhidden we can use

ls -al  or attrib -h path to file commands


2)Q:How do I create multiple nested directories, 
like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?


A- for this we can use mkdir -p command. So it will be like :

mkdir -p these/folders/are/just/for/fun

3)Q:How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, 

so the output would be:
first message
second message

A- On Windows we may use 2 method for this:

   echo -e "first message\nsecond message">>file1.txt
or
   printf "first message\nsecond message\n">>file1.txt

The output will be same:

first message
second message
